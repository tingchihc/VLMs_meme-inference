# VLMs Meme Inference

## Introduction
This repository provides code and tools for performing **Visual Language Model (VLM) inference on memes**. The goal is to leverage state-of-the-art VLMs to analyze and answer questions about meme images, enabling research in **multimodal reasoning and meme understanding**.

Currently, the repository supports:
- BLIP2-Flan-T5-xl
- Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
- InstructBLIP-Vicunna-7B
- LLaVA-v1.5
